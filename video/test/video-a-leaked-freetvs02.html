Taking to the comment section, people shared their take. “Would you have waited for them to call that guy?” a user said. “One cobra meeting another,” joked another. “Snake was like- I want to meet with relatives but why is it hindered bro,” commented a third person. “The phrase- there is a fire in the forest and a snake in the underwear just got real,” added a fourth person. “Ain't no way I'm staying there waiting, my pants would have been down so quick and I was running and screaming around the house while doing it,” joined a fifth person. “That Snake wants to meet Another Snake,” joked a sixth netizen. “I know this is serious and the man was in serious danger, but that was too funny,” commented another.
